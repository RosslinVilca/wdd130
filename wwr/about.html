                <p style="font-size: 25px;">Rafting is an adventure sport that consists of descending whitewater rivers in a shock-resistant pneumatic raft.
                     Inside each raft or Raft there can normally be between 6 and 8 people accompanied by the guide
                     who is located in the back of the boat, from where he directs it.This adventure tourism activity has had spectacular
                     growth in recent years, being one of the most in demand in Andalusia, Spain and the rest of the world.</p>

        <section class="History">
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Rafting comes from the English word raft, which means raft. The origins of this sporting practice date back to the 1950s when the war 
                boats of the Second World War were sought for recreational use in descending rivers. With the development of better materials, the boats were adapted to downhill sports activity.
                After making a name for itself around the world, rafting began to establish itself as a recreational activity in countries such as the United States and southern 
                and central Europe. The French Alps are where the practice of this discipline achieved greatest success. This is how it ended up reaching our rivers in the Catalan
                Pyrenees in the early 80s.A group of French people observed the potential that this territory offers for the development of this activity and introduced rafting for the first time in Spain, 
                decades after the raids stopped descending the Noguera Pallaressa. Llavors√≠ was one of the first places where the discipline became strong and where the first adventure sports centers on the entire peninsula were opened. Among them RocRoi, 
                one of the leading companies in southern Europe in the organization of outdoor sports experiences.In this way, rafting became one of the star activities of Llavors√≠ and what today popularizes the area and shows it as one of the references of outdoor sports throughout the peninsula. Furthermore, whether you are a novice or have experience in whitewater sports, you can enjoy everything the Noguera Pallaresa has to offer and makes it one of the preferred rivers in Europe for rafting.
                Rafting, a rising trend today After Llavors√≠, the practice of this specialty spread to other rivers with less tradition but that offered great possibilities for rafting. The consolidation of this sport as a constantly
                 booming recreational activity has allowed leisure centers to be created in various places on the peninsula. Among them, we also have the Murillo de G√°llego nautical base, the new RocRoi center. Located in the Kingdom of Mallos, in the Aragonese Pre-Pyrenees, the G√°llego River itself is another of the favorite river destinations for rafting lovers. Both centers are among the busiest in Spain and with the greatest tradition. Not in vain, every day the
                rivers are filled with hundreds of boats that make different routes along the river.                
                Rafting has not only developed at a recreational level, but has evolved as a sporting discipline integrated into the Spanish Canoeing Federation. In recent years, the federated practice of this specialty and the rest that are included in the federative entity, has skyrocketed. The pandemic has been a before and after for outdoor sports, and rafting has been no less. In this way, since 2019 the number of federation tokens has doubled to the current 17,000.</p>
